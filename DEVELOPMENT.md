# Development Notes

1. **Inspector** — When using the MCP Inspector with `npm run build:watch`, click "Restart" in the Inspector UI after code changes. File rebuilds happen automatically, but the MCP server process must be restarted.
2. **Claude Desktop** — When developing with `npm run build:watch`, quit and reopen Claude Desktop after code changes. Restarting the connector alone is not reliable.
